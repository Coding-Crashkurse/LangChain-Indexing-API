# Vector Search with LangChain Indexing API

This project demonstrates the use of the LangChain indexing API for efficient vector searching. It focuses on providing an efficient workflow to index, search, and manage documents in a vectorized format.

## Overview:

LangChain's indexing API offers a powerful yet simple method for handling large amounts of textual data, allowing users to extract meaningful insights with vector search capabilities. Specifically, this API provides:

- **Efficient Indexing**: Avoid duplications and re-computations, saving on storage and computational resources.
- **Synchronization**: Ensures your vector store remains updated, eliminating redundancies.
- **Transformation Handling**: Seamlessly work with documents even after they undergo multiple transformation steps, such as text chunking.

The aim is to make vector searches more streamlined and cost-effective, enhancing the overall search quality and results.
